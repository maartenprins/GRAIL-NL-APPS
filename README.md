  anyone
- If you push a new D-Flow application, write in the application documentation:
	- The name of the programmer that built the application
 	- The site where the application was built
- If you want to change an application in this library, make the change in a separate 
 	branch and create a pull request that can be reviewed by the person that made the 
 	first version of the application.
